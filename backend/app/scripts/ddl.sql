    IS 'DESANDER TYPE:A hydrocyclone device that removes large drill solids from the whole mud system. The desander should be located downstream of the shale shakers and degassers, but before the desilters or mud cleaners. A volume of mud is pumped into the wide upper section of the hydrocylone at an angle roughly tangent to its circumference. As the mud flows around and gradually down the inside of the cone shape, solids are separated from the liquid by centrifugal forces. The solids continue around and down until they exit the bottom of the hydrocyclone (along with small amounts of liquid) and are discarded. The cleaner and lighter density liquid mud travels up through a vortex in the center of the hydrocyclone, exits through piping at the top of the hydrocyclone and is then routed to the mud tanks and the next mud-cleaning device, usually a desilter. Various size desander and desilter cones are functionally identical, with the size of the cone determining the size of particles the device removes from the mud system. (Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary).';

COMMENT ON COLUMN ppdm.sf_rig.desilter_type
    IS 'DESILTER TYPE: A hydrocyclone much like a desander except that its design incorporates a greater number of smaller cones.

For that reason, the desilter is located downstream from the desander in the surface mud system. (Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary).';

The primary function of the drawworks is to reel out and reel in the drilling line, a large diameter wire rope, in acontrolled fashion. The drilling line is reeled over the crown block and traveling block to gain mechanical advantage in a "block and tackle" or "pulley" fashion. This reeling out and in of the drilling line causes the traveling block, and whatever may be hanging underneath it, to be lowered into or raised out of the wellbore.

In places where the mapping system is not exactly synchronized with the real ground coordinates, it''s important to understand which local reference system references are made to.  Coordinates that are referenced to a local coordinate system are usually surveyed relative to the local system using metes and bounds or local survey references; maintaining the position of each point relative to its referenced local system is very important to survey accuracy.  Also, some local coordinate systems may change over time, so it is critical to keep track of which local coordinate system was used at the time the survey was acquired.';
